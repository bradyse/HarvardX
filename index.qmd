This website includes the final two projects of the capstone course for the [HarvardX Professional Certificate Program for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science). Below is a summary of each project.

## 1. [MovieLens Project](movielens.qmd)

The goal of this project is to use the frequently-cited MovieLens dataset and employ machine learning principles to achieve a particular level of accuracy in predicting movie ratings.

## 2. [Nebraska State Legislature](ne-legis.qmd)

The goal of this project is for each student to choose their own dataset and employ machine learning techniques to predict a given outcome. For this project, I identify relevant early childhood legislation introduced in the Nebraska Legislature and use machine learning tasks to predict whether the legislation passes.
